\def\AbstractEN{%
Systems programming languages facilitate implementation of software that runs in restricted environments close to hardware, typically operating systems, drivers, real-time and embedded systems.
Implementation of desirable features of such languages, such as generic programming and type system capabilities that prevent programmer errors, are complicated by strict constraints on the run-time properties of the generated code.
This thesis explores a novel combination of C-{}- language with advanced type system features that allow typechecking of highly polymorphic generic code, and demonstrates a type-driven resource management in this language.
As the main result, the thesis provides a proof-of-concept in a prototype compiler of an extended version of C-{}- to LLVM, and describes a type system based on deferred constraint solving that is capable of type inference in presence of multi-parameter type classes and C-{}- subtypes.
We demonstrate the functionality of the type system and the compiler on selected program examples, and report several identified design challenges that may be addressed to make the system more practical.
